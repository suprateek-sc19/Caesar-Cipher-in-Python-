Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock are two prominent volcanic plateaus located just north of the Rogue River in Jackson County, Oregon, U.S. Created by an andesitic lava flow approximately seven million years ago and shaped by erosion, they now stand about 800 feet (240 m) above the surrounding Rogue Valley. The Table Rocks are jointly owned; The Nature Conservancy is responsible for 3,591 acres (1,453 ha), while the Bureau of Land Management is responsible for 1,280 acres (520 ha). Native Americans have inhabited the Table Rocks area for at least 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe away from the Table Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s. The Table Rocks were not protected until the 1970s.

War and famine have destroyed the glory of an old kingdom. The story of how a princess was discovered by a pea was lost in the process. Sebastian, a raven, tries to restore the story using an old tapestry found by a young Prince Rollo, but it is partially torn. It is written that if the legend of the pea is lost, the kingdom will fall at the reign of the 18th king who unfortunately happens to be Prince Laird, the primary candidate for the throne, who is selfish and greedy and believes that greed is what it takes to rule. With the help of Sebastian & Rollo, Laird’s noble and kind younger brother Prince Heath is crowned King in accordance to the law of being the "first" son to enter the throne room during the ceremony, much to the chagrin of Laird. Heath proves to be a far kinder and fairer ruler, sentencing Laird to become Ruler of the Pig Kingdom where he vows revenge. Nine months later, Heath's wife Mariana delivers a daughter, but she dies during childbirth. Laird's greedy and gluttonous wife Helsa also gives birth to a daughter simultaneously. Laird conceives an evil plan to regain the crown. He sends Helsa to take care of Heath's daughter, making the King believe Helsa lost her baby. During the night, Laird swaps his and Helsa’s daughter with Heath’s, intending to give her away so his daughter can rule. Helsa, who feels sympathetic towards her niece as she too lost her mother at a young age, remorsefully begs Laird to give the baby to a loving family.

The 2007–08 National Division Three North was the eighth season (nineteenth overall) of the fourth division (north) of the English domestic rugby union competition using the name National Division Three North. New teams to the division included Bradford & Bingley and Harrogate who were relegated from the 2006–07 National Division Two, while promoted teams included Caldy (champions) and Beverley (playoffs), both coming up from North Division 1, with no team from Midlands Division 1 as the winners of that league, Luton, went into National Division Three South instead.[1][2] The league system was 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw and additional bonus points being awarded for scoring 4 or more tries and/or losing within 7 points of the victorious team. In terms of promotion the league champions would go straight up into National Division Two while the runners up would have a one-game playoff against the runners up from National Division Three South (at the home ground of the club with the superior league record) for the final promotion place.
At the end of the season the league champions were Tynedale, who made up for the disappointment of missing out on promotion from last season's playoffs by winning the title at a canter, finishing ahead of 2nd placed Darlington Mowden Park by a massive 29 points and qualifying directly for the 2008–09 National Division Two.[3][4] As runners up Darlington Mowden Park had to go down to the 2007–08 National Division Three South runners up Cinderford for their playoff game, losing a tight encounter that finished 15 - 14 to the Gloucestershire side.[5][6] The rest of the league was extremely tight, although the relegated sides all probably deserved to go down in terms of results with newly promoted Beverley, West Park St Helens and Morley being the three sides to go down. All three sides would drop to North Division 1 for the following season.[7]
